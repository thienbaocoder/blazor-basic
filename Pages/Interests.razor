        <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier
            and
            novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and
            kayaking.
        </p>
        <p>When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an
            aspiring
            chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the
            front-end
            web development world.
